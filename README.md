Serve mapbox vectortiles via AWS stack

## Goals

These are the main project goals: 

```
[ ] Setup required AWS infrastructure with terraform

[ ] Create an AWS lambda function to handle vectortile queries via REST
[ ] Create mapbox vectortiles directly with postgis using ST_AsMvtGeom() and ST_AsMVT()
[ ] Write a parser to read config-files that define the vectortiles layout
[ ] Create fully automated deployment pipeline.
[ ] Use some caching mechanism for vectortiles
[ ] Use Typescript and typed interfaces where possible
[ ] Have module tests with tsjest/chai
[ ] Generate useful documentation with typedocs
[ ] Learn more about AWS, terraform and typescript
[âœ“] Have fun
```
